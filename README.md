this is a example doctor site i have done with v0 and with mutlilang template and it took me exactly 3-4 hours. i just copied the overall layout from the site of the client which is http://drcuneyttamam.com/

- things to ask to doctor: 
    - what should i put the link to the books or is there going to be any links
    - how will the annoucment section is wanted, what should i add, what should be added to the schema of the announcment
    - the domain address is needed for resend api

- to do 
    - change the next public url to the real domain of the site


if you want modify the admin dashboard and adding markdown editor to this logic, first copy all of the files related to the api routes and then open the chat and make the chat mode to be long context claud. for example i have done a big book in my codebase for changing the overall names of the blog to announcment and blogs to books and this worked good. i have put all of the relevant files that i want to change to the context and pressed with get all context, codebase button...

```
i will need to change the announcment entrie schema to the blog section and the existing blog section to be books section by modifying  @schema.ts @admin @page.tsx @admin-entrie-add.tsx @blog @page.tsx @page.tsx @navigation.tsx . the book section will have author, link to book, coverimage minutes to read which will be generated by amount of text inputted in turkish content, and blog section will have author, cover image, minutes to read, and category, keywords and every one of them will have turkish and english entries as well as turkish and english titles
