this is example of how language provider can be used for an app

-copy the files of i18n
-create a new file called [locale] and put every possible page inside of it.
-create new root layout outside of the app to handle 404 errors, not found requires a root layout and gives error so this is a solution
-create messages at the very root of the project for both tr and en, just copy the directiory
-create middleware.ts
-thats it i guess see t3-example-2 for real life example, or in other words vizilio project.# NextJS-Multi-Lang-Template
