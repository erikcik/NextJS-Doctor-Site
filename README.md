this is a example doctor site i have done with v0 and with mutlilang template and it took me exactly 3-4 hours. i just copied the overall layout from the site of the client which is http://drcuneyttamam.com/

Things to do:
- formatting the overall structure a bit more beatiful [ X ]
- changing the format famaily to something more good [ X]
- putting all of the original text into site []
- implementing language support []
- creating database integeration and creating example route []
- creating protected route with username and password protection []
- implementation of markdown writing for publising the blog []
- able to edit the annoucments, gallery etc... []
